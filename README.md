### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ak and I'm a Information Technology Student based in Ranchi(eastern part of India).

My main focus is on developing & solving using C++, databases ( MySQL, noSQL) but I'm also familiar with Python and frontend technologies (React, javascript in general). On the devops side I have experience with the services offered by AWS.
